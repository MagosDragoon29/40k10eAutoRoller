# 40k10eAutoRoller
A personal Project done for Boot.Dev coursework. This will be a TKINTER GUI that allows you to pick an attacking and defending unit within the ruleset of Warhammer 40k 10th Edition to roll against each other for a single attack per click of a button, dispaying the resulting damage done and casualties.
